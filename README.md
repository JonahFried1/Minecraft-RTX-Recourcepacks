# Minecraft-RTX-Recourcepacks
in da title

If you have an rtx card...

1. install minecraft win 10 edition, 2. install xbox insiders hub, 3. jointhe Minecraft beta for rtx.

So bassicaly just download all of the stuff in this github project and add it to a single folder. Name it whatever. 
Then hit win-key and R-key and search %appdata%, once there hit appdata and then hit local. Once in local hit packages.
When ur in packages search for Microsoft.Minecraft and hit it. After that hit local state and then hit games. 
Hit com.mojang and then hit recource_packs. Move/copy the folder you made into recource_packs. And there ya go.
If you want to do this or something similar you need to go to the marketplace and download toe RTX world templates. 
Then follow the same steps in appdata to get to local state, once there go to premium_cache. Hit world templates and
select the world you want the recource pack from (hit the file and then hit the image to see which one it is). Then hit recource packs
and copy your selected pack into the same location as mentioned before (com.mojang-recource_packs). Nvidia also has some on its website 
that are ok, https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/guides/minecraft-rtx-world-conversion-guide/ scroll to the bottom and you can see the
download.

The included pack is the RTX showcase recource pack, in my opinion its the best one. 

Sorry for the rushed nature of this readme and the fact that the github files aren't in a folder, I simply do not care enough to put more 
time into something that no user will find and use...

Love you, no homo.
